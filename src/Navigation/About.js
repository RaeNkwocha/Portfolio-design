              Hello there! Iâ€™m a Product and Interactions designer, I have a
              Knack for designing, creating and presenting functional digital
              products that exceed expectations, meet user needs and business
              demands. I have worked with startups, collaborated with teams of
              larger organizations, and I'm currently working in a team of
              Product designers for a software company that creates
              multi-faceted products with varying complexities and
              functionalities.
            </p>
            {/* <br /> */}
            <p>
              I Implement Design Thinking, which enables me design intuitive,
              effective and functional user interfaces while maintaining premium
              aesthetics, my designs are also heavily influenced by research of
              a wide demographic of users and their frustrations and this has
              ultimately resulted in good reviews from users of the products.
